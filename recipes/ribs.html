  <strong> Who doesn't love fucking ribs?! </strong>

  <h2><em> Ingredients:</em></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>6 pounds pork baby back ribs</li>
    <li>1 pinch black pepper</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper</li>
    <li>4 cups barbecue sauce</li>
    <li>2 (12 ounce) bottles porter beer, room temperature</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><em>Steps:</em></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Cut ribs into small portions of 2 or 3 bones each. Bring a large pot of
      water to a boil. Season water a pinch each of salt, black pepper, and
      crushed red pepper to the water. Boil ribs in seasoned water for 20
      minutes. Drain, and let the ribs sit for about a half an hour.
    </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.</li>
    <li>
      Lightly coat the ribs with barbecue sauce. Cook the ribs over high heat
      for a 5 to 10 minutes on each side to get a nice grilled look to them.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place grilled ribs in a slow cooker. Pour remaining barbecue sauce and one
      bottle of beer over the ribs; this should cover at least half of the ribs.
      Cover, and cook on High for 3 hours. Check ribs every hour or so, and add
      more beer if needed to dilute sauce. Stir to get the ribs on top into the
      sauce. The ribs are done when the meat is falling off the bone. The ribs
      were cooked completely in the first process, the rest is about flavor and
      texture.
